                For this research project, my partner and I examined data from Twitter using social network analysis. The goal was to examine the                  effectiveness of different companies’ hashtag campaigns in creating interest and selling their products. We examined the social                     network graphs of four search terms: #Pixel, @toyota, #yogabook, and ToysRUs.<br>

                Within each graph, we measured how connected the users were to see how many consumers the company can reach directly, the popularity of each user, and how much influence the user has on the entire network. This data is useful for monitoring brand reputation and identifying key people on social media who actively engage with different companies’ content.  The data was extracted using nodeXL that uses Twitter’s search function.
