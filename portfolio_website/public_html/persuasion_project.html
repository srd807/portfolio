                I worked with a PhD student on her research focused on persuasion technology and healthier eating. The overarching goal for this                   project was to examine why people eat healthy and use this information to persuade others to make healthier eating choices.<br>

                The project was divided into a survey examining people's healthy eating habits and an analysis of users' personalities from reviews posted on pulse recipes from an online recipe community, Allrecipes.com. The data was extracted from the website using a web crawler and scraper that was built using a combination of Python, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Webdriver, and SQLite. The data extracted from the website was then analyzed using the Linguistics Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) tool to find the reviewersâ€™ Big Five personality traits.
