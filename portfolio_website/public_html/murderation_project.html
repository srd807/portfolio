                My team’s challenge was to create a branching narrative game that branches depending on the player’s choices, which must be meaningful. Each branch had to be equally                  fun and believable. We were also tasked with optimizing the assets in the game without creating multiple versions. <br>

                The game consists of three acts: exploration, investigation, and accusation. During the exploration act, player’s choices will                      determine which character will be murdered either through dialogue options or picking up items. During the investigation act,                      players will examine the crime scene, interrogate other characters, and explore the mansion for clues. Once the player has decided                 on a murderer, they will start the accusation act and try to successfully argue for their case using evidence they found or through                dialogue options. Several playthroughs may be necessary for players to gather all the correct evidence to successfully accuse the                  murderer.  The game was created using Unity 2017, C#, and Git. <a href="https://daylonball.github.io/allthingsinmurderation/">Game can be played online</a>
