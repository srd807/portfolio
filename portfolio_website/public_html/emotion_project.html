                The focus of this project was to create a new way to convey emotion over instant message by animating the message through changing                 the size, colour, and movement of the text. This project focused on learning the design process of reduction and elaboration, early                stage prototyping, and different evaluation techniques (usability testing, cognitive walkthrough, questionnaires, and interviews).<br>

                For the medium fidelity prototype, we used a horizontal approach by implementing all the main components on a high level. Our team focused on evaluating the user’s perception of the emotion animations rather than the flow of the application. This prototype featured six preset emotion animations: angry, excited, sad, tired, dying, and embarrassed. The prototype was developed using Processing and Photoshop.
